# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The prework study guide was built to keep notes on what I've learned about Git, JS, CSS, and HTML during my precourse modules.
It was built in order to keep my notes together in one easily accessible location and to practice using VS Code and GitHub.
While building this study guide, I've learned some basics of HTML, CSS, and JS and how to merge my feature branches with my main branch on GitHub.
